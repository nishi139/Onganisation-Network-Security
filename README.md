Mainly Focus: NETWORK SECURITY for an ORGANIZATION


BY:-
# NISHI SRIVASTAVA

#INTRODUCTION

1.In this project we have shown an organization or a firm network connectivity wit its all sub branches or departments working collaborately as a part of it through various networking devices. <br>
2.This whole organizational setup comprises of its restricted accessibility to their members only which we have implemented in this project.
3. Network security is the practice of preventing and protecting against unauthorized intrusion into corporate networks. As a philosophy, it complements endpoint security, which focuses on individual devices; network security instead focuses on how those devices interact, and on the connective tissue between them.
4.This project inculcates the network security of an organization from various noticed cyber hacks.

#MODULES:

1.DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
2.Routing Protocols
-RIP
-EIGRP

4.ACL(Access-Control List)
5.Frame –relay
6.MPLS(Multiple protocol  label Switching)
-VLAN(Virtual Local Area Network)
-VTP(VLAN Trunking Protocol)


#DHCP CONFIGURATION:
A DHCP Server is a network server that automatically provides and assign IP addresses, default gateways and other network parameters to client devices.<br/>
It relies on the standard protocol known as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DHCP to respond to broadcast queries by clients. <br/>
Without it , the network administrator has to manually set up every client that joins the network.<br/>
DHCP servers  assign each client with unique dynamic IP address, which changes when the client’s lease for that IP address has expired.<br/>

# CONCLUSION:
- **FUTURE SCOPE**
  -  Enterprise connectivity is exploding, driven by globalization, virtualization and social computing. As corporate perimeters dissolve, the network security focus switches towards app and data-level security solutions.<br/>
  -  Who needs network security? Why don't we just build encryption and antimalware protection into end-points and simply enjoy open networks? From a security perspective that's always best and it's in line with the Jericho Forum vision. But in the real world it's not so simple.<br/>
  - One of the biggest security concerns today is the insider threat. In response to this, you can deploy many interesting techniques in networks to detect anomalous user behavior. Valuable intelligence can be derived by profiling, fusing and mining message content, traffic patterns or IT activity.<br/>
  - The future of network security might be far from clear-cut. One thing is clear - it will certainly be richer and more sophisticated than we've seen so far. Determining how to plan for a business environment in which everyone is connected and security expectations are high is not trivial. We all have to do it.<br/>
